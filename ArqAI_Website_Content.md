### **Problem Section ("The Hidden Crisis")**

*   **Headline:** Your AI Future is Being Built on a Foundation of Chaos.

## **Page: Platform (`/platform`)**

### **Hero Section**

*   **Headline:** The Integrated Foundry for Enterprise AI
*   **Sub-headline:** ArqAI is not a single tool, but a complete, end-to-end platform that unifies the three pillars of trusted AI: Compliance, Security, and Operations.
*   **Visual:** An architectural diagram showing how CAPC, TAO, and ODA-RAG interlock at the center of the enterprise.

---

### **Deep Dive: CAPC (Build with Confidence)**

*   **Headline:** The Compliance-Aware Prompt Compiler
*   **Sub-headline:** Bake compliance in, don't bolt it on.
*   **Body Copy:** ArqAI's patented compiler acts as an intelligent guardrail at the point of creation. Define your business and regulatory policies in a central hub, and the Foundry automatically enforces them during both agent assembly and execution. This prevents compliance violations before they can ever happen, turning your policies from static documents into active, automated enforcement.
*   **Visual:** A screenshot of the "Policy Hub" UI, showing a list of rules.

---

### **Deep Dive: TAO (Run with Trust)**

*   **Headline:** Trust-Aware Agent Orchestration
*   **Sub-headline:** Every action, cryptographically signed and proven.
*   **Body Copy:** Our zero-trust framework treats every AI action as a sensitive transaction. Before execution, the platform issues a single-use, cryptographically-signed capability token that serves as permission. This token is consumed upon use, and the entire lifecycle—issuance, validation, and consumption—is recorded on an immutable audit log. This provides a non-repudiable, court-admissible record of your AI's operations.
*   **Visual:** A close-up of the "Audit Log" from the Operations Center, showing the token IDs and timestamps.

---

### **Deep Dive: ODA-RAG (Govern with Insight)**

*   **Headline:** Observability-Driven Adaptive RAG
*   **Sub-headline:** Move from a black box to a transparent, managed workforce.
*   **Body Copy:** How do you know if your agents are performing well? ArqAI's observability loop uses a secondary AI quality analyst to score the confidence and quality of every agent's output in real-time. This data feeds into a central dashboard, giving you unprecedented insight into your AI workforce's performance and flagging low-confidence results before they can impact your business.
*   **Visual:** A close-up of the "Confidence Score" gauge and the run history panel from the Operations Center.
