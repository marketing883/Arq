# Deploy for thearq.ai and preview.thearq.ai.
#
# Fetches a ref into the checkout, rebuilds, restarts the service, and rolls
# back if the build fails or the site does not come back healthy. Which site
# it acts on comes entirely from the calling unit: ACI_SERVICE names the
# systemd unit, and everything else - the app directory, the repo root - is
# read back from that unit. The script knows nothing about the other sites.
#
# Runs as the deploy user, not root. The only privileged thing it does is
# restart one systemd unit, via a sudoers rule naming exactly that unit.
#
# This is NOT installed on the box. /usr/local/bin/aci-deploy is a small
# launcher that fetches the requested ref and runs this file out of it, so
# the deploy logic ships with the code it deploys and a fix to this file
# takes effect on the next deploy with no reinstall step.
#
# The ACI_ prefix on the variables is not a copy-paste slip: the launcher is
# shared across every site on this box and reads those names. Renaming them
# here would need a second launcher, which is the thing that arrangement
# exists to avoid.
#
# Ported from the ACI repo's deploy/aci-deploy.sh, which carries five fixes
# earned the hard way in production - the unarmed ERR trap, devDependencies
# stripped by NODE_ENV, a missing .env.staging aborting the run, env-source
# drift, and an unreadable env source. Keep them in step.
#
# Usage: run by the launcher, or by hand as: aci-deploy <ref>

# -E matters as much as -e here: without errtrace the ERR trap is not
# inherited by shell functions, so a failure inside build() exits without
# ever running restore(). Observed live - a build that aborted in the
# prebuild env check exited in 19s with no rollback and left the checkout
# on the new commit while the service kept serving the old build.
